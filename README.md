This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I usually favor TypeScript over JavaScript and have mostly used Redux with React so I went straight JS and straight React to shake up my skills.

I chose REST over GraphQL for the first run because it was both more familiar and the docs were easier to follow.

I used the following tools and libs in addition to react:
- create-react-app
- react-paginate
- jest
- fetch-mock
